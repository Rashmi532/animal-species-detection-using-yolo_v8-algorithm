# 🐾 Animal Species Detection Using YOLO v8 Algorithm

This project uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect different animal species in images.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `CODE.py` - Main Python script for running YOLOv8 detection
- `OUTPUT1.jpg`, `OUTPUT 2.jpg`, `OUTPUT 3.jpg` - Sample output images
